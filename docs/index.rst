Green Tsetlin documentation
=========================================

Green Tsetlin (GT) is a Tsetlin Machine (TM) 
framework developed to solve real-world problems using TMs.
Several frameworks already exist that provide access to TM
implementations. However, these either lack features or have a
research-first focus. GT is an easy-to-use framework that aims
to lower the complexity and provide a production-ready TM
implementation that is great for experienced practitioners and
beginners.

More details on the framework: `ArXiv paper <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.04212>`_

Software can be found here: `GitHub <https://github.com/ooki/green_tsetlin>`_
