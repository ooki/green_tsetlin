green_tsetlin
==============

green_tsetlin let you easily train and do inference on a Coalesced Tsetlin Machine.
It is CPU based and will use AVX2 / NEON instrics in the backend if available.  

The package does not provide all bells and whistles a Tsetlin Machine can have, instead it support a 
carefully selected subset of features. As such, once we
reach version 1, then the API will be stable.

If you want the lastest research features the [TMU project](https://github.com/cair/tmu) is the place to go.
This project is intended to by tested, stable and intended more toward production.
